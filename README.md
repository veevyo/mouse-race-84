# mouse-race-84
a game for the TI-84+CE written in C. it's a clone of Space Race.

# known issues
- i'd like there to be a proper end screen, but for some reason the game just crashes on gameover
- collision should be improved

# attribution
- i used the <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain">C/C++ CE programming toolchain</a>
- you can change/edit/redistribute my code as you see fit, i'm not bothered
